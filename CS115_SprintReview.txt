Team Name: Michael and the boyz

 Actions to stop doing:

- Stop showing up late to the morning scrum meetings without informing the team. The reason 
for this is almost every scrum meeting, someone shows up late and we waste a lot of time 
wondering where they are or sitting idle.

- When someone has to leave a meeting early and doesn’t follow up or to catch up from other 
members about what they missed in the meeting. The reason for this is because many meetings 
are mostly taken up by catching up from other meetings for members that weren’t there.

- Daily scrum meetings are taking too long when people disrupt the flow and ask questions. 
A fix for future meetings is let everyone talk, then ask questions after.

- Stop multitasking during meetings because we need everyone’s focus on the taak at hand 
and sometimes people get too distracted.

Actions to start doing: 
	
- We should participate more as a group because most meetings are dominated by one or two people talking throughout.

- We should be messaging more in slack about availability and schedules instead of ignoring messages. The reason for
 this is because we are always wondering if someone can show up or not.

- Have set meeting times on weekend or a weekly basis where we can commit to the project and have meetings to get 
everyone on the same page. The reason for this is because we have not have many weekly meetings outside of the daily 
scrum meetings that have been impactful/meaningful.

- Do more demonstrations/walk throughs of the code because it gives people a deeper understanding of the code.

- Start using more comments and better formatting so that the code is easier to understand when we don’t have time 
for a walkthrough



Actions to keep doing: 
- Keep having individual working meetings, because it leads to more productivity.

- Keep a motivated outlook for the project, because it allows for more productivity when working with other team members

- Keep commiting to github and communicating with members of the team whenever we do so in order to keep everyone updated

 Work completed
- As an app user, I need a basic user interface, so that the app is easy to use 
- As a developer, I need to have a database setup so that the AI can store/retrieve data and information about the 
English language 


Work not completed:
- As a user of the app, I want to be able to teach the AI new grammatical structures so that i can use those structures 
when communicating (Teaching the AI new grammatical structures was not implemented yet, but the tasks that we had listed
 under this user story were moved to Sprint plan 2).
