Sprint Plan 2 
AInfant
Oct 20, 2016


Goal: Have basic UI made in Android Studio, which will take input from user and store it in a database.


Task listing, organized by user story: This section lists the user stories, in priority order from most important (top) to least important (bottom). Within each user story, there needs to be a list of tasks required to implement the user story, along with the time estimate for each tasks (preferably less than or equal to 6 ideal hours). This should look like: 






1. As an app user, I need a basic user interface, so that the app is easy to use
	2.  As a developer, I need to have a database setup so that the AI can store/retrieve data and information about the English language 


	3. As a user of the app, I want to be able to teach the AI new grammatical structures so that i can use those structures when communicating
	



Implement dictionary search (checking database library to see if already exists)
Design Database Structure(drawing)
Implement new design of database (hard code)
Alter related functions to accommodate new database structure


Implement word teaching (add word to database)
Implement validation functionality
Add UI for appending words to specific database columns (example: nouns, locations, verbs)
Brainstorm synonym implementation 


Brainstorm of how to implement grammar checking
Create Tokenizer for input
